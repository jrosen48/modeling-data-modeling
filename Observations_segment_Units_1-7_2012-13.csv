Also, the teacher initially told me she was going to discuss 4 displays with her class.  So I took photos of these 4 displays. But the class sent through these 4 displays rather quickly so the teacher started pulling out more displays. I did not get photos of these since atheist teacher then started teaching from her math book and I didn't want to disturb the class by walking to the front to take more pictures.  These missing displays (from artifacts) were similar to initial ones chosen.

Coding during the gallery walk activity limited to what I could hear which was a fraction of what was going on in the classroom.

T.  asking each student how many problems  they got right on HW

Goal for today: 
 you will learn to find the Measures of Center of a data set : range 
mean, median and mode
T. asks class ""why do we collect data?Yesterday we collected data on the number of  letters  in your names ( artifact 1) 
two students give answers ( inaudible ) then T. gives some reasons 
why are graphs used so much ? student answers not audible
